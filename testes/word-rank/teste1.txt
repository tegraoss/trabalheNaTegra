End of passion play, crumbling away. I'm your source of self-destruction. Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear. Leading on your deaths' construction

Taste me and you will see. More is all you need. Dedicated to how I'm killing you.

Come crawling faster, Obey your Master. Your life burns faster, Obey your Master. Master.

Master of Puppets I'm pulling your strings. Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams. Blinded by me, you can't see a thing. Just call my name, `cause I'll hear you scream. Master. Master. Just call my name, `cause I'll hear you scream. Master. Master.

Needlework the way, never you betray. Line of death becoming clearer. Pain monopoly, ritual misery. Chop your breakfast on a mirror.

Taste me and you will see, More is all you need. You're dedicated to how I'm killing you.

Come crawling faster. Obey your Master. Your life burns faster. Obey your Master. Master.

Master of Puppets I'm pulling your strings. Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams .Blinded by me, you can't see a thing. Just call my name, `cause I'll hear you scream, Master. Master. Just call my name, `cause I'll hear you scream. Master. Master.

Master, Master, Where's those dreams that I've been after?.
Master, Master, You promised only lies.
Laughter, Laughter, All I hear and see is laughter.
Laughter, Laughter, Laughing at my cries.

Fix Me.

Hell is worth all that, natural habitat. Just a rhyme without a reason. Neverending maze, drift on numbered days. Now your life is out of season

I will ocupy, I will help you die, I will run though you, Now I rule you too.

Come crawling faster, obey your Master. Your life burns faster, obey your, Master. Master.

Master of Puppets I'm pulling your strings. Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams. Blinded by me, you can't see a thing. Just call my name, `cause I'll hear you scream, Master. Master. Just call my name, `cause I'll hear you scream, Master. Master.
